# CNN Project

- given a set of land use images, the program will be able to train a convolutional neural network model that can tell which land use category an image belongs to (agriculture, forest, etc)
- written in Python using Jupyter Notebook
- mainly use three Python machine learning libraries: TensorFlow, Keras and scikit-learn
- uses techniques like data augmentation, dropout, L2 regularization and batch normalization to optimize the performance of the model and reach an accuracy of over 95%

# Note
- MultiClass_Model is the main file; 2Class_Model is the simpler version that can only handle two categories
- dataset used for training and testing the model is from UC Merced at this link: http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html
- this project follows the tutorials here: https://www.jiuzhang.com/course/88
